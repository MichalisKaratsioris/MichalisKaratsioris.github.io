                    A face and a name associated all over the world with Argentine Tango.  Alejandra Mantiñan has 
                    been immersed in tango over the past 40 years. She is generally regarded to have been the pioneer 
                    in creating supreme excellence in the execution of the female role in tango. Alejandra is one of 
                    the women who has not only set the standard for her dancing, but also for her intensive research 
                    and teaching methods. She has taken part in almost every important festival in the world. According 
                    to a survey of the most popular tango magazine "The Tangueta", Alejandra Mantiñan is the 
                    woman of "Los piez milagrosos" (the miraculous feet) and is the most nominated dancer among participants 
                    of the World Tango Championship.

                            She began dancing at the age of 8 in the <em>Escuela Nacional 
                            de Danza</em> where after 10 years she earned the "Maestra Nacional de Danza" diploma while 
                            at the age of 17, she entered the "Ballet de Danza Contemporanea" by Soledad Fernandez laboratories 
                            at San Martin Theater. In 1988, in parallel with her artistic career, she started studying 
                            in the university of medicine (UBA) where she regularly attended courses, specializing in 
                            traumatology and rehabilitation, and acquiring specific know-how in motor science, which is 
                            now an integral part of her teaching method ATM focusing on Biomechanics. Her innovative pedagogical 
                            method ATM can be used in every style, Tango Salon, Milonguero, or the more new tendencies of the 
                            evolving Tango Dance.
                        </p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                            She took classes mainly with Mingo & Ester Pugliese, and Antonio Todaro 
                            (one of the most creative tango dancers who loved inventing long, sharp, and complex sequences of flashy 
                            steps is still seen in many famous professional tango dancers today) to whom she ended up being his 
                            assistant for five years. It was then that she started delving into the secrets of tango and 
                            from his style she was inspired to develop her Tango technique. Apart from Todaro, the most 
                            important information for women came from Ester Pugliese and Marijo Alvarez who are the only two 
                            female teachers that she accepts as a reference point in her career and changed completely her 
                            point of view on the couple. The former is about the line of Tango and the latter for the biomechanics part.

                            For 8 years together with Gustavo Russo, were the principal dancers of 
                            the show “Tango Pasión”, covering 340 cities all over the world, performing in the most important and 
                            prestigious theaters such as Sistina Theater in Rome, Broadway Theater in New York City, Colon Theater in

                            Berlín Philharmonic to mention just a few. She was given glowing reviews worldwide, singled out for special mention 
                            by the New York Times in the Broadway premiere of “Tango Pasión”. She had the honor to perform with the live 
                            orchestras of Osvaldo Pugliese, Horacio Salgan, Mariano Mores, Jose Basso and Sexteto Mayor. Other notable 
                            tango shows that Alejandra has participated in was "Tango Danza", "Tango X2", "A night of Tango" and 
                            "Tango Seducción". Alejandra has also served as a top judge for the Tango Mundial competition as well as many 
                            other competitions from around the world such as the Asian Tango Championship, and the European Tango Championship.
